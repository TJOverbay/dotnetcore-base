# aspnetcorebase
Trying to establish a reasonable base project using ASP.NET Core, Angular2, Typescript, LESS

Future plans include incorporating ideas from ASP.NET Boilerplate. I would like to easily choose between different libraries and tools:
- Angular2, Aurelia, React
- LESS or SASS
- Bootstrap, Material Design, uikit, Foundation, base
- Yeoman generators for these options
- Load and debug the project in Visual Studio or VS Code without any manual setup
